<h2>I. Project Overview and Video</h2>

<p>
    This racing simulator combines many of the techniques we learned throughout the course. It combines collision detection, rectangular bounding boxes, normal
    and rotational acceleration, and path planning to build a car racing environment. As seen above, the user races, using the WASD keys, against AI cars that 
    are driven by a PRM built with Uniform Cost Search path planning techniques. The first car to achieve three completed laps wins. There is a GUI that displays
    the time of the user's car, the number of laps completed, and a map of the track and all of the cars on it, with the user indicated with a yellow star. 
</p>
<p>
    The track is built with processing's built-in rectangles and boxes, while the cars are sourced from the Google Drive of free models. Each car has a different
    acceleration, max speed, width, and length. The collisions between the cars and walls are a scaled-back version of the rigid body activity in class. It does not
    adjust any rotational aspects of the car's motion, only the position and velocity. The PRM model was built with the same framework as the one from project 1, 
    utilizing a priority-queue frontier that searches all possible paths until it's empty. The motion and collisions are all built in 2D, with the simulation being 
    rendered in 3D.
    
</p>
<p>
    The racer must press the space bar after the game loads to start it. After the user finishes the third lap, they can keep racing around the track as much as they
    would like, but the game is effectively "over". The AI cars will continue to race even after the game ends, as they are looping around the track along their 
    PRM-generated path. There is a shortcut that can be seen on the map that the AI cars can not take. This gives the user the ability to win the race even if 
    they have the slowest car in the game. The wall collisions are very bouncey and the shortcut is very narrow, so the user must hit the shortcut perfectly to
    gain an advantage. 
</p>

<h2>II. Key Algorithms and Methods</h2>
<p>
    As mentioned earlier, the racing game is built using a combination of different topics discussed in class. Many of the techniques are modified to be either
    simpler or computationally faster, almost in a hacky way. 
</p>
<h4>Collisions</h4>
<p>
    The game is driven by both car-to-car and car-to-wall collisions. While both are driven by rectangular bounding box logic, there collisions are generated in 
    different ways. The initial collision checking was done by seeing if any of the four lines generated by the four corners of each car intersected any of the four
    lines generated by the four corners of each obstacle. If there was an intersection of the lines, the collision checking method would return the index of the obstacle
    or car that the car currently being checked collided with, and the car was "bounced" off of the object by subtracting the positions. This didn't seem very natural, as
    the bounce after hitting a wall depended on the center of the wall object, rather than the angle of the car with respect to the wall's normal. This technique is still in
    use for determining the collisions between cars since it doesn't appear glitchy or unnatural.
</p>
<p>
    The collisions between the walls and the cars are now determined by looking at the four corners of each car and seeing if they are inside any of the wall objects.
    If so, the car is bounced off based on which corners were inside the wall.

<p>
    As seen in the picture above, with nodes 3 or 4 colliding with the wall the car's velocity would be set to the normal of the opposite face of the car. This was a large
    upgrade from the previous method of collision resolution because the car bounces sideways, not backwards awkwardly.
