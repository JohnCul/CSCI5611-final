<h2>I. Project Overview and Video</h2>
<img height=500 width="auto" src="./images/part1Gif.gif">
<p>The gif is very slow for some reason, the video for it is in the images folder. I did not style part 1 at all because the entire purpose of it was to show the understanding of the 
    algorithm and environment. I used the exact same function and styled it in Part 2.
</p>
<p>I replaced the logic where the algorithm chooses the nodes closest to the start and goal positions with logic that allows any node available to the start and goal 
    nodes to be a possible solution. If the node can see the start or goal without an obstacle in the middle, it will be a potential starting/ending node for the best path.
